# Emotion Recongmition Project

This project aims at building an AI model using Pytorch to recognize human emotions using face capture data. The dataset used is the IEMOCAP dataset. 
To solve the problem, it was decided to use a RNN achitecture (LSTM/GRU to be more precise), to exploit the temporal aspect of the data : For example, a smile
can be seen on a still frame, but there is also actual movement that leads up and move away from the smile, that is what this project aims at capturing.
